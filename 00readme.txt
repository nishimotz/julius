About Julius
=============

"Julius" is an open-source high-performance large vocabulary
continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) decoder software for
speech-related researchers and developers.  Based on word N-gram and
triphone context-dependent HMM, it can perform almost real-time
decoding on most current PCs with small amount of memory.

It also has high vesatility. The acoustic models and language models
are pluggable, and you can build various types of speech recognition
system by building your own models and modules to be suitable for your
task.  It also adopts standard formats to cope with other toolkit such
as HTK, CMU-Cam SLM toolkit, etc.

The core engine is implemented as embeddable library, to aim to offer
speech recognition capability to various applications.  The recent
version supports plug-in capability so that the engine can be extended
by user.

The main platform is Linux and other Unix workstations, and also works
on Windows (SAPI/console). Julius is distributed with open license
together with source codes.


What's new in Julius-4.1.5
===========================

The version 4.1.5 is a bug-fix release.  Two bugs are found relating
search algorithm, word insertion penalty handling on grammar
recognition and LM score handling of the first word on the second
pass.  They have been fixed on this release.  If you have been
encountering unreasonable search failures on the second pass, they 
may be eased by using the newest version.

Other bugs are also fixed.  See "Release.txt" for the full list of the
fixed bugs.
