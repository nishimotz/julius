.SH "NAME"

    mkgshmm
   \- convert monophone HMM to GS HMM for Julius
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
mkgshmm converts monophone HMM definition file in HTK format into a special format for Gaussian Mixture Selection (GMS) in Julius.
.PP
GMS is an algorithm to reduce the amount of acoustic computation with triphone HMM, by pre\-selection of promising gaussian mixtures using likelihoods of corresponding monophone mixtures.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
(1) Prepare a monophone model which was trained by the same corpus as target triphone model.
.PP
(2) Convert the monophone model using mkgshmm.
